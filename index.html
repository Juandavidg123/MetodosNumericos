        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm 19 years old and I'm studying systems engineering. I'm currently in the fifth semester of my career.
            Since I was a child, I've always liked how things worked in the world of technology. In school, they also
            taught me a little programming, which is where my interest in this career comes from. Mathematics has always
            been easy for me, so I never had a problem with it. I've always liked puzzles, so one of my hobbies is
            solving "Rubik's Cube" and so on.</p>

        <h2>School</h2>
        <p>When I was in high school, I learned a variety of fascinating subjects. During my junior year, I was actively
            participating in the soccer club and won a soccer tournament with my team. Before graduating, I had
            completed all required and technical courses and earned outstanding grades in math and technology. My senior
            year in high school was boring as the pandemic occurred in that year.</p>

        <h2>University</h2>
        <p>When I entered university, I decided to study systems engineering. During my first year, I took intensive
            programming classes. While taking advanced classes in programming paradigms, I completed a money management
            project. Before entering university, I had already gained experience doing small programming courses. My
            university experience is proving to be quite interesting and challenging.</p>
